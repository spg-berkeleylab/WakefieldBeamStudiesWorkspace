Option 3 of the SiD DD4hep model, with Cu absorber plates in the HCal.

SiD_o3_v02 differs from SiD_o2_v02 only by HCalBarrel_o3_v02_00.xml and HCalEndcap_o3_v02_00.xml having replaced the Steel235 19mm absorber with 17.55mm of Cu, and new materials added in materials.xml

Total thickness with Cu absorbers is by 40*1.5 = 60mm smaller for barrel, and 45*1.5 = 67.5mm smaller for the endcap.
